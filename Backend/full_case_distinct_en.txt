Crime Details When I was 10-12 years old, a circus man picked me up from a fair, took me with him by train, and kept me for 3-4 days. After that, when I asked about my home and parents, he said that my parents had died. I became suspicious of his words, so I ran away from there and reached Parasnath Station by train. Living at the station, I used to deliver water to shops and work as a laborer in shops, which sustained my life. In this sequence, the lockdown happened, and all shops closed, due to which I started facing a shortage of work, and consequently, a shortage of money. After that, on 11/07/2020 at night, I climbed onto a shop in front of the park and was trying to remove the roofs of all the shops. In the same process, the corrugated sheet of one shop's roof came off after some effort, after which I entered the shop. From there, I stole two new mobile phones, 4-5 old mobile phones, and approximately 7000 rupees from the cash box and was leaving when a man approached me shining a torch. Seeing him, I ran in a hurry. During the escape, a new mobile phone fell somewhere. Later, I saw that no old mobile phone was working, so I threw them out of a moving train and kept one new mobile phone with me. Later, all the money was spent, after which I started working at PPP's egg shop. In this sequence, PPP's mobile phone broke, so I gave him my mobile phone to insert a SIM card. Both PPP and I used to talk on that phone, but the mobile phone remained with me. Before this, 3-4 years ago, I had been jailed from Koderma Tilaiya for girl

harassment during search and seizure. After being released from jail, I started living in QQQ, where I was jailed in QQQ PS Case No. - 65/19 dated 21/11/19 on charges of mobile theft. During the Corona lockdown, DDD was released from jail and started living in ZZ Bazar. In this sequence, I committed this theft, and I was using it. This is my confessional statement.
